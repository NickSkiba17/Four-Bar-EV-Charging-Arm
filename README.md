# Four-Bar-EV-Charging-Arm
Designed, simulated, fabricated, and programmed an automated robotic charging arm for electric vehicles using a four-bar linkage mechanism. The system extends from within a compact frame to reach an EV charging port when triggered by an infrared sensor, demonstrating the engineering design cycle from mathematical optimization to physical prototype.
