# Four-Bar-EV-Charging-Arm
Designed, simulated, fabricated, and programmed an automated robotic charging arm for electric vehicles using a four-bar linkage mechanism. The system extends from within a compact frame to reach an EV charging port when triggered by an infrared sensor, demonstrating the engineering design cycle from mathematical optimization to physical prototype.

## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates the complete engineering design process for an automated robotic charging arm using a **four-bar linkage mechanism**. The system autonomously extends from a compact frame to connect with an electric vehicle charging port when triggered by an infrared sensor.

### Project Objectives
1. Design a kinematically optimized four-bar linkage using MATLAB
2. Model and simulate the mechanism in 3D CAD (Autodesk Inventor)
3. Fabricate precision parts using laser cutting
4. Program intelligent control system with Arduino
5. Validate performance through physical testing
